This is just a simple google docs thing, me playing around with Remix and sockets.

# Installation

After forking and cloning, run `npm install`, then you need two environment variables:

- `BASE_URL_DEV`: set to `http://localhost:3000/`

- `PORT`: set to `3000`

# Tests

To run the tests: `npm run test`.
